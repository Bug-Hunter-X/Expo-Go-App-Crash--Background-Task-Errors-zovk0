This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a background task. The error message is not very helpful and usually appears as a blank screen or crashes, therefore the user must use the log output from the terminal to identify the error. The background task may fail to start, stop, or execute correctly. This can happen due to several reasons, including incorrect task configuration, platform-specific limitations, or conflicts with other parts of the application.
